## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict diabetes in patients using machine learning models based on their medical data. The dataset contains records collected from [DoctHers](#source), which include patient health metrics and diagnostic results.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [DoctHers Dataset: Jan 2023 - Feb 2023](./DoctHers-Diabetes-Jan-23-to-Feb-23.csv)
- **Number of records**: 500 patients
- **Features**: Health metrics such as glucose levels, insulin levels, BMI, and other factors influencing diabetes diagnosis.

The dataset was preprocessed before training machine learning models to ensure clean and usable data.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated for this project:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting

Each model was trained on the dataset, and the one with the highest performance was selected for final evaluation.

## Results

- Best model: **[Model Name]**
- Accuracy: **[Accuracy]**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict diabetes in patients using medical data. By analyzing multiple models, the project selects the best-performing model for accurate prediction.
